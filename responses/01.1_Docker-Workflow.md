# Edit the workflow file

## Step 2: Edit the workflow file

We are going to edit the current workflow file in our repository by adding a job that turns our `Dockerfile` into a `Docker Image`.

### :keyboard: Activity: Edit the workflow file and turn the Dockerfile into a Docker Image

1. [Edit the current workflow file in our repository]({{ repoUrl }}/blob/docker-workflow/.github/workflows/ci-workflow.yml)
2. Rename `ci-workflow.yml` to `cd-workflow.yml`:
3. On line 1, change the name from `Node CI` to `Docker CD`
        ```yaml
        name: Docker CD
        ```
4. Add the following job to your workflow file:

```yaml
  Build-and-Push-Docker-Image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    name: Docker Build, Tag, Push

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Download built artifact
      uses: actions/download-artifact@master
      with:
        name: webpack artifacts
        path: public
    - name: Build, Tag, Push
      uses: mattdavis0351/actions/docker-gpr@v1.3.0
      with:
        repo-token: {% raw %}${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}{% endraw %}
        image-name: tic-tac-toe
```

5. Commit the newly edited workflow file to your repository
