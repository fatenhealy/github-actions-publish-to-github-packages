# Moving the workflow file to `.github/workflows/ci-workflow.yml`

There is a file on this branch called `ci-workflow.yml`. But, now I need your help!

## Step 1: Move the workflow file

As a bot ü§ñ, I can only do so many things. Setting up a workflow for you isn't something I can do.  Don't worry, I'll be here to help you, just follow these steps and we should be good to go. üëç

Please move the `ci-workflow.yml` file into a new folder and update the contents of the file.

At first, it will look like this:

When you're done renaming, you will have created a new directory and moved the file into that new directory. Your file title should look like this:

### :keyboard: Move the `ci-workflow.yml` file

1. [Edit the file location]({{ repoUrl }}/edit/ci-workflow/.github/ci-workflow.yml) by changing its name from `ci-workflow.yml` to `workflows/ci-workflow.yml`.
2. Commit the file to the `ci-workflow` branch once you have changed the path:
